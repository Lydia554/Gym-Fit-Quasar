           In many sports we talk about playing in a team or about the team spirit being the main focus. 
          But I have rarely experienced a community like this. Everyone is welcome here. In the group training sessions, people support and push each other - 
          no one has to achieve their goals alone, the cohesion within the box is simply unique.`,

          I developed my love of coaching through basketball. Seeing how people recognize their own potential and manage to overcome their own limitations again and again is indescribable.
           Seeing someone start to be proud of themselves and dare to do things they never thought possible (every step towards a new skill, every personal best) makes me happy. 
           I love teaching people new things and showing them possibilities. 
          And because I know that this is a very big responsibility, the quality of training and personal support are my top priorities. For this reason, coaching is my passion.`,

          I always have a quick saying on my lips and the right song in my playlist for every workout. My sporting roots are in team sports. 
          18 years of handball have shaped me what it means to train with and for each other - to push and drive each other.
           When I teach people something new, show them "You can do it!" and they go home at the end of the lesson laughing and in a good mood, it's an incredible feeling.`,
