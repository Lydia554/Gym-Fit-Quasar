        "On Thursday 15th and Friday 16th March, racegoers will be encouraged to take part in ‘The Rope pulling Challenge’. Inspired by the famous Cheltenham Hill, people will go head to head to see how fast can they pull a rope, based on heavy they are. If you’re at Cheltenham, make sure you head along and take part. Not only this, in partnership with Great British Racing, legendary jockeys AP McCoy and Luke Harvey have created a Jockey themed workout, to help you get your steps up in the Sport Relief app.",

Detox with fresh fruits, healthy salads and hot brunch staples washed down with bottomless bubbles.",
